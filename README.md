## General info
The project brief was to create a simple message generator program that outputs a new, random message every time a user runs the program.

The generator could follow any theme and I chose to do a play on a 3 card Tarot reading.

The mandatory component of this brief was that the program's random message be made up of at least three different pieces of data

## Sample Output

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- Node

## Setup
To run this program, store locally and use node with the file:\
`$ node script.js`

## Status
This project is complete for the JS component of the full-stack-engineer-career-path. However, I am keen to use it as a basis for a full html/css site or app (so stay tuned ;>)
