## General info
The project brief was to create a simple message generator program that outputs a new, random message every time a user runs the program.

The generator could follow any theme and I chose to base mine on a 3 card Tarot reading.

The mandatory component of this brief was that the program's random message be made up of at least three different pieces of data

## Technologies
- JavaScript
